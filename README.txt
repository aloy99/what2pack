Welcome to the What2Pack Website!
The aim of this website is that you can find information and prepare yourself for your next planned trip. Based on your destination and travel dates. 

The website gives you:
Packing advice based on the weather (API)

- What we have done:
On the landing page, you can fill in your destination and travel date, when you click on search you will see packing advice based on the weather API.
If you click on the login icon, you can sign up or log in on What2Pack and sign out.

- Technologies:

And a router that can show corresponding presenters according to different URL.


- Third party components:
Location finder: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=
Ant Design: https://ant.design/ 
DatePicker, Button, Input, Icon, Popconfirm, Notification

- Note: 
Because we are using Vite, 
1. all the extensions for js files should be .jsx instead of .js.
2. When using React you need a React import everywhere you use JSX (e.g. Views): import React from "react";
