I have created all the views and presenter files. 
And a router that can show corresponding presenter according to different URL.

Note: Because we are using Vite, 
1. all the extension for js files should be .jsx instead of .js.
2. When using React you need a React import everywhere you use JSX (e.g. Views): import React from "react";
